# GitHub Demo

This project is a simple webpage that displays all the names listed in a JSON. Serves as a basic project for people learning Git to contribute to

### Set up

To get this project running on your machine:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `yarn start`
3. Visit http://localhost:5000 to see the webpage

This project uses Yarn 2's [Zero-Installs](https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs) feature, so there's no need to install packages upon cloning.

## Default Branch
